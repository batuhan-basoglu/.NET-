# .NET Web API with Angular

This is a .NET backend server connected to a Angular front end. It retrieves api from https://api.hatchways.io/assessment/blog/posts?tag=tech using GET method from REST API. Angular and .NET connected in simplest way possible since VS Code doesnÂ´t provide a template for .NET and Angular synchronisation. Angular could be removed to compile only .NET using swagger. For the sake of not breaking the code no changes will be made but controllers from Web API are still there in case.

# Usage
Execute "dotnet run --launch-profile https"
